# ScoreKeeper
This is a Udemy course project. It is a simple web app made in HTML, CSS and Javascript to keep score of two players.
There's not much visible CSS in the app. The CSS file contains just one class which the Javascript file uses to add/remove to the classList of span1 and span2 variables.
You can increase the max score through the input. JS funciton is written to handle max score below 1.
